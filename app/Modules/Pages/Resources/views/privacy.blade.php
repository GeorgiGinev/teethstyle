            information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance,
            depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can
            match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you
            through a communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also
            use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make
            the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the
            purposes of verification. If, however, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already
            maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your
            identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided
